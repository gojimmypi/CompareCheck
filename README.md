# CompareCheck
Do cross-branch compares work properly?

This is the MASTER branch.

I would have expected comparing Branch [One](https://github.com/gojimmypi/CompareCheck/tree/CompareBranchOne) to Branch [Two](https://github.com/gojimmypi/CompareCheck/tree/CompareBranchTwo) to work differently. Although branch two is selected on the left, the contents of the Master branch are actually being compared to Branch One on the right.
